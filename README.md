# 🧬 IHCGenie — Breast Cancer H&E to IHC Conversion & Severity Prediction  
### AI-powered Histopathology Image Processing System  
*(Learning/Academic Project)*

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for **processing breast cancer histopathology images**, converting **H&E images into IHC-style images**, and performing **cancer severity prediction** using a deep-learning backend.

It is built using **Flask**, **Python**, and **Machine Learning**, with a simple web UI for uploading and analyzing images.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a learning project implemented using concepts and resources from online tutorials, research papers, and YouTube references.

## 🧩 Overview

Pathologists often rely on H&E-stained images for diagnosis, but **IHC (Immunohistochemistry)** provides more specific biomarker-level insight.  
Since IHC staining is expensive and time-consuming, this project attempts to:

### **Phase 1 — Convert H&E → IHC-like image**  
Using a deep learning image-translation model.

### **Phase 2 — Predict cancer severity**  
Using the generated image or extracted features.

## ⭐ Features

- 🔬 **Upload H&E image for analysis**  
- 🧪 **Generate IHC-style output**  
- 📊 **Predict severity / classification score**  
- 💾 **Save analysis sessions in database**  
- 🖼️ **Show before/after images**  
- 🌐 **User-friendly Flask web interface**

## 🔄 Working Process

1. User uploads an H&E image  
2. Backend saves file into `/uploads/`  
3. ML model converts it → IHC-style image  
4. Severity prediction model evaluates the image  
5. Results saved in database + displayed on UI
